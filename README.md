<h1>WiFi GPS Checker</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Code made for a university subject project, it consists of a GPS Module and a ESP32 microcontroller with a integrated WiFi antenna. It checks if there are WiFi connections nearby.</p>
<p>If it detects one, it stores it, along with the GPS location it detected it (if available) and sends it via MQTT to a raspberry pi with node-red installed, to store it in a local database and show them in a grafana map.</p>
